                    <p>I'm Jordan, a second year <b>Information Technology and Commerce student</b> at The University of <br>Queensland. 
                        I have experience coding <b>HTML, PHP, CSS, JavaScript, Python and SQL</b>. After completing DECO11OO, DECO14OO
                    and DECO18OO, I have developed an appreciation for design and see how it is extremely relevant to many types
                    of programming. My coding skills have also become much better, as I was a complete beginner at coding when I 
                    started University two years ago. Despite this, I want to focus <br>on improving my JavaScript and PHP skills as 
                    they are extremely useful languages. Apart from working, thats what I'll focus on in my 2019 break!</p>

                <h2>Case Study 1: Early Prototype</h2>
                <p>This piece of assessment was my favourite in this course. I enjoyed being able
                    to visually create an application and receive feedback on it without actually having to 
                    create it. 
                </p>
                <p>In foresight of this assignment, I had the idea to use a dynamic map as the primary navigation system of my application. 
                    The first thing I decided to do was to choose a dataset that worked with this idea.
                    I quickly realised that I must look for a dataset that has some sort of location variables such as latitude and longitude. 
                    I decided to make a mind-map of potential datasets, which has been presented on the right. I ended up choosing SLQ's Picture
                    Queensland dataset as I was interested in working with images and felt like I had the best application idea
                    for this specific dataset.   
                </p>
                <section class="imgs">
                    <img width="380" height="180" src="Images/1.jpg">
                    <img width="380" height="180" src="Images/2.jpg">
                </section>
                <p>After choosing an SLQ dataset, I then looked for inspiration from other already existing applications. 
                    Yelp and Google maps were very helpful as they helped me define how I would implement a dynamic map 
                    as the primary navigation system of my application. At this point I had also came up with a great idea to 
                    juxtaposition the datasets historic images with modern images. This led to me sketching what I wanted the 
                    application to look like. 
                </p>
                <p>At this point I was ready to finalise my idea and create my inVision prototype. I decided to discuss my 
                    idea with my tutor and received some valuable feedback. This feedback led to me implementing a few extra 
                    features and becoming more confident in my application. The last thing I did before creating my inVision
                    prototype was write the early prototype report.</a>
                </p>
                <p>To construct my inVision prototype I decided to 
                    create the visuals in paint.net. This was a poor decision as it was very time consuming and could have
                    indefinetly been a shorter process if I used a more advanced image editing software. All in all 
                    paint.net still provided the appropriate tools for me to make the prototype look how I wanted it to. In the
                    process of creating these visuals I also frequently asked for feedback from another student on the aesthetics
                    and navigability of the application. My prototype can be accessed here and images of it and its functionality 
                    have been included below.
                </p>

                </section>
                <p>In my eyes this assessment piece was a success. I felt like my inVision prototype was highly defined at
                    such an early stage in terms of aesthetics and functionality. As well as this my pitch was extremely successful
                    as I wrote and memorised it. The only area of this assessment I was slightly lacking in was the report as I lost marks
                    by not including academic research to justify my application. I now understand why this is important as it is crucial to 
                    justify the application to employers or even potential investors. This assessment piece also helped me throughout the whole course as it lay the 
                    foundation for the rest of the work I'd be doing.

                    <h2>Case Study 2: Work In Process</h2>
                    <p>Although my team and I received a high grade for this assessment, I still felt like it could have been improved in 
                        many ways. An image of the team in a meeting is shown below.
                    </p>

                    </section>
                    <p>The design process for this assessment piece was quite simple. To decide on the specifics of our application we decided
                        to use inspiration from our previous assessment. From a unanimous decision we decided to take the dynamic map based design 
                        of my application and combine it with Alex's chosen SLQ mining accident dataset. We then finalised this concept over a 
                        a few contacts of brainstorming. At this point I decided to write the concept section of the report; this helped all of our team members 
                        as reading it gave them a full understanding of the application they were creating. A team member also created wire frames 
                        of the application, which can be seen below.
                    </p>
                    <section class="imgs">
                        <img width="390" height="200" src="Images/3.png"> 
                        <img width="200" height="200" src="Images/wip1.webp">
                    </section> 
                    <p>As the design process took a bit longer than planned for, there was a tight deadline to write the report and code the application for this assessment
                        piece. To plan for this we decided to divide the remaining sections of the report and set a deadline with adequate time remaining to code the application.
                        Although this deadline was tight, the team member knew they had to meet it if we were to present a solid application. Unfortunately, not all team members
                        met this deadline. Josh and I decided to make what we could in the little time that we had, and produced the work in process application 
                        together. As well as this we did not have time to write or rehearse our pitch. This was all a reflection of our poor planning. We failed to plan
                        at the beginning of the assessment which ended up in us using our time inefficiently. Although planning at a later stage saved us this time the tight deadline
                        that put a lot of pressure on our team which could have been avoided. This highlighted to our team that we needed to plan in advance for the next assessment piece. 
                    </p>
                    <p>In conclusion I felt like with better planning and a bit more effort from all team members this assessment piece could have been
                        completed to a much higher standard. This assessment piece was also a good learning experience for me of leading a team.

                <h2>Case Study 3: Final Delivery</h2>
                <section class="final-delivery">
                    <p>The final delivery of our application was successful in some aspects but failed to live up to expectations in others. Our team 
                        succeeded at creating a presentable booth for the trade show. We had a poster detailing the physical museum, and a powerpoint 
                        presentation about our application. These were created in a meeting with all of our team members. We also had a demo of our 
                        application on two laptops. For our pitch I pre-wrote a script for all of our team members to try and remember or use to create their
                        own. Our team members were also all dressed professionally in button ups. The following is a photo of our booth for the trade show. 
                    </p>
                    <section class="imgs1">

                    </section>
                    <p>Images of our final application can also be seen above. The home page lived up to our expectations by providing a unique 
                        primary navigation system. A lot of work went into creating the map that is available on our application. I contributed 
                        towards this by writing code to set boundaries to the map, so users cannot get lost. I also contributed by making the 
                        home page look much more aesthetically pleasing than our previous in our work in progress assessment. I feel like this aspect
                        of our application lived up to our expectations.  
                    </p>
                    <p>On the other hand the core gamification aspect of our application was quite unsuccessful. This feature was fully completed with many 
                        JavaScript functions, however, the API had a very long loading time. The API also did not work as intended from our design. As we lacked planning for the work in process assessment
                        we decided to meet up early and allocate roles for this assessment piece. We allocated the role of completing the task of implementing the API to display 
                        certain data and randomise scenarios to one team member. This team member was unresponsive most of the time except when at contacts. 
                        Although the team member assured they would complete it, it was still somewhat incomplete on the day of the trade show. 
                        This was very unfortunate as our application could have been much better with the gamification feature fully completed. To reflect
                        on this I think that allocating tasks was the wrong approach. We should have worked as a team to build the application from the base 
                        first and then allocate smaller tasks. This would ensure that all team members would have had a full understanding of the application 
                        and not be overwhelmed with a specific task and no other knowledge of the application.
                    </p>
                    <p>A report was also involved in the final delivery. I decided to do the first section about the concept myself and two other team members
                        elected to do the reflection together. We felt like we succeeded in this area as we ensured the report was of high standard. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Overall, the final delivery somewhat lived up to my initial expectations. It was let down by the gamification feature not being as it was 
                        intended to be. On the positive our report was written well and we were successful at the trade show.

            <section class="case-study" id="n4">
                <h2>Case Study 4: Portfolio and Participation</h2>
                <section class="case-gap">
                    <p>I will first talk about the participation aspect of this assessment. Apart from my low workshop attendance, I feel like I participated in 
                        every aspect of the course. I attended most contacts, consulted with tutors in a professional manner, participated in critiques and put
                        my best efforts into both team assessments. I also felt like I went above and beyond in the team assessment pieces by leading and organising 
                        my team as best as I could. Next semester I will aim to choose a workshop time that is more suitable for me. 
                    </p>
                    <p>The portfolio took quite some time for me to create. From research I gathered that most portfolios have a large title page. 
                        The image on my title page is designed to spark curiosity and it also fits well with the dark color scheme of my website. 
                        During the process of creating this portfolio, I also decided to add an 'About me' section. This section adds a nice touch to 
                        the website as it smoothly transitions the title page into the case studies. The case studies were also originally meant to 
                        be contained on top of one another, flowing vertically from the top of the document. To create a better user experience I 
                        decided to implement a JavaScript function to only show one case study at a time. As well as this I used a function to make 
                        some of the text on my home page interactive. I ensured to test that this feature did not make the website harder to navigate
                        by asking another student to complete certain tasks. The following two images show an early prototype of my portfolio and a prototype
                        of the finished product. 
                    </p>

                    <p>I organised and managed my time well for this assessment piece as I completed it well before the due date. As an overall reflection I feel like I performed best
                        in the individual assessment pieces of this course. Thank you for reading my case studies!
